# Simple-API
Made this recently as part of an internship application test. 

It is an API which simulates a very simple wiki, ie a collection of documents where each document contains only a title and text-only content and nothing more. Users can view a list of available documents via the /documents endpoint and can view and edit documents via the /documents/<title> endpoint.
